### About me

I currently work at a small finance company where I design and impliment technical solutions common to most businesses. 
My current tech stack centers primarily around python, javascript, node.js, and laravel at the moment.

I'm currently pretty adept at doing data engineering operations and writing webscraping scripts. I'm currently trying to become better at more front end tools. 
I'm passionate about technology designed by and for the many feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the content you see on my blog.

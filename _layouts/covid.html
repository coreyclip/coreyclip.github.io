                                        For the most part it's impossible for the maintainer of this site to verify the accuracy of any of the

                                        where you are not at risk of coming in contact with Covid-19 or being infected.
                                        
                                        As always follow the recommendations of official guidelines laid down from State and Federal authorities and note 
                                        that we should during these time exercise extreme caution even if we feel that a particular establishment appears safe.

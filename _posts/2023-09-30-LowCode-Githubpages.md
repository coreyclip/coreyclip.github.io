I created my first youtube video and it's a overly long and meticulous tutorial on creating a completely free website with github pages, similar to the website hosting this blog. 

My video editing skills are a work in progress and after a few different takes I'm still not tremendously confident that I like how I sound but iteration not talent has been my life strategy thus far. I hope it's helpful to someone :)

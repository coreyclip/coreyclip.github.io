## How to Vote in US Elections from Taiwan: Quick Guide
Here's the main steps for U.S. citizens living in Taiwan who want to vote in the upcoming U.S. federal elections based on information from the American Institute of Taiwan:

1. **Request Your Ballot**: 
   - Complete a **Federal Post Card Application (FPCA)** after January 1, 2024, to request absentee ballots for all federal elections that year.
   - Use the [FVAP.gov](https://www.fvap.gov/fpca) website to fill out the FPCA and opt for electronic delivery of ballots (email, internet, or fax), if available for your state.
   
2. **Receive and Complete Your Ballot**: 
   - States are required to send ballots 45 days before federal elections. You can confirm your registration and ballot delivery status online at [FVAP.gov](https://www.fvap.gov/links).

3. **Return Your Completed Ballot**: 
   - Some states allow electronic submission. For states requiring a paper ballot, you can drop off the ballot at **AIT Taipei** or **AIT Kaohsiung** during business hours, or mail it to:
     - **American Citizen Services Unit, American Institute in Taiwan, 100 Jinhu Road, Neihu Dist., Taipei, 11461**.
   - Ensure it is placed in a postage-paid envelope or one with sufficient U.S. postage.

4. **Research Candidates and Issues**: 
   - Visit the [FVAP links page](https://www.fvap.gov/links) for election resources and subscribe to Voting Alerts via email or social media for updates.

For questions, contact AIT's Voting Assistance Officer at [VoteTaipei@state.gov](mailto:VoteTaipei@state.gov).

"I read in a book that a man called Christ went about doing good. It is very disconcerting to me that I am so easily satisfied with just going about." - Toyohiko Kagawa 

Toyohiko Kagawa was a Japanese Christian Pacifist, anti-facist, and labor activist who's life and work exemplify Christian praxis in the face of cold capitalism and cruel facism. In Japanese, individuals are typically refered to by their last names instead of their first names, so for this blog post I'll be refering to Toyohiko Kagawa as simply Kagawa. Kagawa was born during the reign of the emperor Meiji in 1888. A time during which Japan experienced massive social, economic, and political changes that rapidly transformed the country from a feudal society to one that would attempt regional supremacy in the years leading up to World War 2. Kagawa was born to a businessman and one of his concubines in the city of Kobe. 

- Conversion to Christianity
- frustration with theological technicalities and instead wanted to focus on christ's parables and action (the good samaritan)
  - Christian Truth == Christian Action
  - We should focus on healing the world, not healing our doctrine
- Kagawa's work with poor
  - he lived with the poor and documented their lives, sharing this information with broader japanese society. 
  - Frequently arrested for labour activism during strikes
  - continued the noble christian tradition of writing while in prison
  - when released from prison organized relief work for the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake 
  - worked for universal male sufferage and eventually women's suffarage 
- Kagawa's pacifism
  - in 1940 Kagawa wrote an apology to the Republic of China for occupying China, an act which he got promptly placed in jail for again
  - After being released he went to the US to try and prevent a war from breaking out between japan and the US 
  
- Brotherhood Economics
  - advocated that the Church, the cooperative movement, and peace movement unite to provide an alternative to capitalism, state socialism, or facism
  - WE MUST BRIDGE OVER THE GAP BETWEEN PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS WITH BROTHERLY LOVE. OTHERWISE SOCIETY WILL NEVER BE SAVED
  - Dorthy Day liked the book a lot

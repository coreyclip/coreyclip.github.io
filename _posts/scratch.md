A lot of beginner programmers, simply copy and paste code they find online hoping that it'll produce the results they are looking for. I know I did. And while this behavior is often discouraged by both programming and foreign language teachers alike. I will say that parroting is better than not programming or not speaking a foreign language at all. When I myself was learning Serbian, I found that I made more progress awkwardly trying to make conversation in cafes than I did trying to read dry grammar books or memorize lists of vocabulary. I think teachers often warn against such a sink or swim approach because it creates frustration. But once you grow comfortable with frustration, you will learn the correct patterns simply from mistakes. 


The simpliest example I can think of is realizing that if a post you see talks about manipulating X but you need to manipulate Y. You apply a function you copied and pasted to Y and not just some undeclared variable called X.

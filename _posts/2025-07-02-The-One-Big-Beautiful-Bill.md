# Notes on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act 
Here's my own notes on what it's included in the budget reconcilliation bill that's being fast tracked through congress. I started this awhile back when the bill had first been announced. In the interest of just having it up as a reference as the bill is being spend through I decided it would be prudent to get this up now as a sort of easy to point to artifact of some of the more concerning provisions of the bill. I'll try to loop back and see what eventually makes it into the final bill when this is all over. 

# The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBA) Provisions 

## Separation-of-Powers

### 1. Bond Requirements to Enforce Contempt of Court  

**Bill section:** § 70302 — “Limitations on Enforcement of Contempt”  

#### *What it does*  
• Bars any federal court from enforcing an injunction or temporary restraining order unless plaintiffs first post a Rule 65(c) bond.  

#### *Why it matters*
• Lets executive-branch officials ignore court orders with minimal risk.  
• Civil-rights, environmental, and FOIA plaintiffs rarely post bonds, so their remedies would become toothless.  

In short, the clause bluntly weakens judicial authority, thereby diminishing the judiciary’s role as an effective check on executive power.  

---

### 2. At-Will Federal Hiring Option  

**Bill section:** Title VIII (Senate HSGAC amendment) — “At-Will Federal Service”  

#### *What it does*  
• Forces every new civil servant to choose between:  
  1. **Keeping** Title 5 due-process protections while paying an extra **10 percentage-point** retirement contribution, **or**  
  2. **Becoming** an at-will employee while still absorbing a **5-point** hike.  
• Adds a 10 percent surcharge on any payroll deduction to a tax-exempt group (e.g., union dues).  

#### *Why it matters*
• Creates strong financial pressure to surrender whistle-blower and appeal rights.  
• Shifts bargaining power for 2.2 million workers toward the White House and agency heads.  

Consequently, the amendment erodes a professional, non-partisan civil service and strengthens executive control of federal personnel.  

---

### 3. Revoking Non-Profit Tax-Exempt Status  

**Bill section:** § 80205 — Treasury Power to Revoke Tax-Exempt Status  

#### *What it does*  
• Authorizes the Treasury to strip 501(c) status from any nonprofit it “determines knowingly supports terrorism,” without explicit judicial review.  

#### *Why it matters*
• Employs a vague standard that can be weaponized against advocacy groups critical of the administration.  
• Chills free speech by threatening organizations’ financial lifelines.  

Thus, the provision hands the executive an oversized tool to punish dissent and silence civil society.  

---

### 4. A Decade-Long Ban on State AI Regulation  

**Bill section:** Title IX, § 91001 — 10-Year Pre-emption of State AI Laws  

#### *What it does*  
• Prohibits states from “enacting, enforcing, or giving effect to” any measure that “materially governs the design, training, deployment, or liability” of AI systems until **2036**.  

#### *Why it matters*
• Voids dozens of state privacy, deep-fake, autonomous-vehicle, and child-safety statutes.  
• Creates a regulatory vacuum that tech-policy experts warn will harm consumers; meanwhile, polls show **71 percent** public opposition.  

In effect, the clause grants Big Tech a decade-long holiday from local oversight while channeling all rule-making through agencies loyal to Trump.  

## Economic and social impacts
## Individual & Family Tax Provisions  

### 1. Extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts  

**Bill section:** § 1010 — “Permanent Rate Reductions”  

#### *What it does*  
- Makes the Trump 2017 income-tax brackets and estate-tax thresholds permanent.  

#### *Why it matters*
- [Congressional Budget Office (CBO)](https://www.cbo.gov/) projects **76 %** of benefits will flow to the top quintile.  
- Lost revenue: **\$1.3 trillion** over ten years.  
- Continues to balloon the national debt with no real promise of returns.  

---

### 2. Higher SALT Deduction Cap  

**Bill section:** § 1012 — “\$40,000 State-and-Local Tax Cap”  

#### *What it does*  
- Raises the SALT deduction ceiling from \$10 k to **\$40 k** through 2030.  

#### *Why it matters*
- The [Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB)](https://www.crfb.org/) finds **98 %** of gains accrue to households earning **\$200 k+**.  
- Shrinks future state tax bases, forcing state and local governments to be more reliant on federal control and funding.  

---

### 3. Child Tax Credit Expansion  

**Bill section:** § 1015 — “Enhanced Child Tax Credit”  

#### *What it does*  
- Boosts the credit from \$2,000 to **\$2,500** per child and indexes it to inflation.  

#### *Why it matters*
- Low-income parents simultaneously lose SNAP and Medicaid support elsewhere in the bill, offsetting any cash benefit.  
- Adds \$115 billion to the deficit.  

---

## “Workforce Incentive” Measures  

### Exemption of Tips & Overtime from Income Tax  

**Bill section:** § 1020 — “Tax-Free Gratuities and Overtime Pay”  

#### *What it does*  
- Excludes all reported tips and overtime premiums from taxable income starting in 2026.  

#### *Why it matters*
- Helps only a sliver of service workers — most already owe no federal tax.  
- Employers gain an incentive to cut base wages and relabel pay as “tips.”  
- Undermines Social Security financing and invites widespread income reclassification (e.g., CEO “bonuses” rebranded as tips).  

---

## Savings & Investment Gimmicks  

### MAGA Accounts (Money Account for Growth and Advancement)  

**Bill section:** § 2025 — “Establishment of MAGA Trust Accounts”  

#### *What it does*  
- Federal seed deposit: **\$1,000** for every child **born 2026-2028**.  
- Guardians may contribute up to **\$5,000** per year.  
- Withdrawal schedule: 50 % at age 18, 100 % at 25 for qualified uses, remainder at 30 unrestricted.  
- Tax treatment: capital-gains rate for qualified uses; ordinary income otherwise.  

#### *Why it matters*
- Functionally inferior to existing 529 plans and Roth IRAs outside of the initial seed money.  
- Time-limited seed money creates geographic and generational inequities.  
- Adds \$28 billion in outlays with minimal long-term benefit.  

---

## Ballooning the Debt for Tax Cuts to Wealthy Donors  

### Trillion-Dollar Tab & Credit Downgrade  

**Bill section:** § 3001 — “Budgetary Effects”  

#### *What it does*  
- Authorizes deficit increases totaling **\$2.56 trillion** through 2034.  

#### *Why it matters*
- Gross federal debt reaches **\$38.8 trillion** by 2034 (CBO).  
- [Moody’s](https://www.moodys.com/) has already shifted the U.S. to a negative outlook; a formal downgrade would raise borrowing costs for every consumer and business.  

> **Takeaway:** The OBBA’s “beautiful” façade hides regressive tax cuts, compliance nightmares, gimmicky savings accounts, and a mammoth debt spike — while exposing Republican hypocrisy over debt limits.  

---

## Safety-Net Retrenchment (SNAP, Medicaid & More)  

### SNAP Error-Rate Penalty  

**Bill section:** § 4110 — “State Liability for Over-Payments”  

#### *What it does*  
- If a state’s SNAP error rate exceeds **6 %**, the state — not USDA — must repay **100 %** of over-payments.  

#### *Why it matters*
- Shifts actuarial risk to states, pressuring them to restrict benefits rather than focus on delivering support to vulnerable populations.  
- Pushes states to cut caseloads or automate harsh eligibility filters, affecting **2.3 million** low-income households.  

---

### 75 % State Share of SNAP Admin Costs  

**Bill section:** § 4112 — “Administrative Match Increase”  

#### *What it does*  
- Raises the state share of SNAP admin spending from **50 % to 75 %** — the first hike since 1964.  

#### *Why it matters*
- Low-income and rural states face **\$5 billion/yr** in new costs; some may close intake offices, lengthening queues.  
- The [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/) projects **460,000** eligible families could lose benefits by 2028.  

---

### Medicaid Restrictions on Gender-Affirming Care  

**Bill section:** § 3220 — “Crenshaw Amendment”  

#### *What it does*  
- Imposes a **nationwide ban** on Medicaid funding for gender-affirming care — hormones, counseling, surgery — for both minors **and adults**.  

#### *Why it matters*
- Contradicts prevailing medical standards; affects an estimated **300,000** transgender Medicaid enrollees.  
- Could increase untreated gender dysphoria, raising mental-health costs.  
- Strips states of the right to use federal dollars contributed by their residents for medically approved care.  

---

### Medicaid Abortion-Provider Exclusion  

**Bill section:** § 3222 — “Hyde-Plus Restriction”  

#### *What it does*  
- Denies Medicaid reimbursement to nonprofits that provide abortion services outside rape, incest, or life-threat exceptions.  

#### *Why it matters*
- Targets Planned Parenthood and many hospital systems; **880,000** patients could lose routine cancer screenings and contraceptive care.  

---

### Long-Term-Care & Enrollment Freezes  

**Bill sections:** §§ 6011-6014 — “Temporary Regulatory Suspensions”  

#### *What it does*  
- Blocks HHS from enforcing minimum staffing in nursing homes, transparency in Medicaid institutional reporting, and streamlined Medicaid/CHIP enrollment **until 2035**.  

#### *Why it matters*
- Could lower staffing ratios for **1.2 million** nursing-home residents.  
- Slows Biden-era simplification, risking **950,000** children’s coverage.

## Economic & Social Ripple Effects  

| Domain | Projected Impact (2025-2034) | Source |
|--------|------------------------------|--------|
| Poverty rate | +0.9 percentage point (≈ 3 million people) | [Center on Budget & Policy Priorities (CBPP)](https://www.cbpp.org/) |
| SNAP household spending | −\$11 billion (reduced grocery sales, rural grocers hit hardest) | [USDA ERS SNAP Multipliers](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap/) |

> **Takeaway:** OBBA’s tax cuts concentrate gains at the top, while safety-net cuts and cost shifts ripple through state budgets, grocery stores, hospitals, and ultimately Main Street employment.

**Bill section:** Title I-E, § 108  

#### What it does  
Any uncrewed air, surface, or subsea system valued under **\$750 million** may be transferred to allies without the customary 30-day congressional notification.

Abolishes the rule that cuts for-profit colleges off from federal aid if graduates have unaffordable debt-to-income ratios.

The “spectrum-for-potholes” swap angered Pentagon planners but was overshadowed by the tax fight.  

---

### 13. Sunset of the PCAOB in 2029  
**Bill section:** Title X-C, § 100312  

#### What it does  
Shuts down the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board after 2029.

Indexes the new above-the-line tips deduction to the **elderly CPI (CPI-E)** instead of CPI-U.

**Provision:** Manager’s Amendment, 10 Jun

Removes \$2 billion for Pentagon black-budget intelligence programs to satisfy the Byrd Rule.

It dawned on me the other day while talking to someone new to programming that learning a programming language follows steps that mirror human language aquisition

First we start by simply parroting. Think of a young child repeating words that his or her parents speak to it. Consider a person with one semester of spanish navigating Mexico city. We start by simply throwing out patterns and depending on our luck, get either the responses we are looking for and thus reinforcing the pattern or something completely different which frustrates us. 

A lot of beginner programmers, simply copy and paste code they see hoping that it'll produce the results they are looking for. I know I did. And while this behavior is often discouraged by both programming and foreign language teachers alike. I will say that parroting is better than not programming or not speaking a foreign language at all. When I myself was learning Serbian, I found that I made more progress awkwardly trying to make conversation in cafes than I did trying to read dry grammar books or memorize lists of vocabulary. I think teachers often warn against such a sink or swim approach because it creates frustration. But once you grow comfortable with frustration, you will learn the correct patterns simply from mistakes. 


The next stage is a kind of transition between simply pattern following to manipulation of patterns based on lessons learned from other patterns. You know that you've arrived at this stage when you look at a stackoverflow solution and understand that the post has the information you need but you need to tweak the code a bit to make it work for your use case. The simpliest example I can think of is realizing that if a post you see talks about manipulating X but you need to manipulate Y. You apply a function you copied and pasted to Y and not just some undeclared variable called X. 

The road to mastery, is simply the a granularization of the patterns you've learned and a realization that the patterns are all stacked on top of each other.
